## The challenge

### [Challenge Link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6)

Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using
the [GitHub users API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users#get-a-user) and get it looking as close to the
design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_:
  Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

- ‚úÖ Fetch and process data from public API using axios library
- ‚úÖ API error handling
- ‚úÖ Search and view users
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Dark and light themes
- ‚úÖ Hover Animation
